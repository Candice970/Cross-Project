# Reflection

Contributing to the "Math Booster System" project provided valuable experience in real-world collaborative development. Here are some key takeaways:

## Lessons Learned
- I learned how to navigate and contribute to an open-source project on GitHub, including forking, branching, and submitting Pull Requests.
- Improving documentation made me more aware of the importance of clear communication in collaborative work.
- Writing unit tests helped reinforce the concept of test-driven development and how testing contributes to long-term project stability.

## Challenges Faced
- Initially, the project lacked labeled issues or a CONTRIBUTING.md file, so I had to explore the codebase to identify areas for improvement.
- Aligning with the project's structure without breaking any existing logic required careful reading and testing.

## Collaboration Experience
- Though it was a solo contribution, I followed best practices like commenting on potential issues and keeping PRs small and descriptive.
- I now feel more confident collaborating on larger projects and working with unknown codebases.

Overall, this assignment sharpened both my technical and communication skills, which are essential for open-source and team-based software development.
