# Contribution Plan

## Project 1: EucretiaM-Math-Booster-system
**Repository Link**: https://github.com/EucretiaM/EucretiaM-Math-Booster-system

### Selected Issues/Features:
- Improve and expand the `README.md` with clearer setup instructions and usage guide.
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to guide new contributors.
- Add basic unit tests for core functions (if implemented).
- Fix any detected minor bugs in the frontend or backend logic.

### Strategy:
1. **Phase 1 – Documentation**: Start by enhancing the documentation (README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md) to improve project clarity and onboarding for new developers.
2. **Phase 2 – Testing**: Explore the source code and write unit tests for any functions/modules already implemented.
3. **Phase 3 – Bug Fixes or UI Tweaks**: If any errors or inconsistencies are found in code or UI during exploration, make focused fixes and propose them via PRs.

## Communication:
All changes will be clearly discussed in issue comments before submission. PRs will be small, focused, and aligned with the repository's style and goals.
